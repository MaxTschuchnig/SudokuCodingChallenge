            allowed. If you are unsure about what is ok and what is not, ask staff</li>

            there will be tips on Friday and Satturday at 10:30am</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Please go home and sleep during the night. We will turn off the server over night
            (around 10pm) for it to regenerate sudokus, so there is no use to stay up all night.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You can change your username (we can still recognize your team based on the email),
            however, users with problematic usernames will be renamed and you will get a warning. If you are unsure if a
            username is ok, please contact the staff</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Winning teams have to prepare a 3 minute presentation about the core feature of
            their winning solution. A slide with their team name and an ilustration is enough, however, more can be
            shown</li>
